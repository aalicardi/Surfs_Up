# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Project
For this project, we are interested in opening a surf and shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Investor support is needed, but concerns about the weather have been mentioned. Thus, we will analyze a weather dataset from Oahu.

### Purpose
Pull and analyze weather data in Oahu for the months of June and December.

## Analysis Results  

### June

### JUNE VS DECEMBER
* The average temperature in Oahu is 74.94 °F in June and 71.04 °F in December.
* The maximum temperature in Oahu in June is 85 °F while the maximum temperature in December is 83 °F. This is not a major difference.
* The minimum temperature is Oahu in June is 64 °F while the minimum temperature in December is 56 °F. 


## Summary
In our analysis, it is apparent that temperatures very much more in December than they do in June. Despite this variability in temperature, it is still rather temperement and does not drop below 56 degrees.

In general, I do not think that temperature should be the main weather metric to analyze when determining the feasibility of opening a surf shop in Oahu. Other metrics, such as precipitation and wind speeds, should also be considered.
